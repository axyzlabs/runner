# Phase 5: Security Hardening Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-10-26
## Status: COMPLETE
## Priority: P0 - CRITICAL

## Overview

This document summarizes the critical security fixes implemented in Phase 5 of the GitHub Actions Runner container project. All P0 and P1 security vulnerabilities have been addressed.

## Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Remove Sudo Access (P0 - CRITICAL) ✓

**Security Risk**: CVSS 8.8 - Privilege escalation vector

**Implementation**:
- Removed sudo package from system dependencies
- Removed sudoers entry for claude user
- Fixed /go directory permissions to allow non-root Go operations

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/dahendel/projects/runner-worktrees/phase-5-security/Dockerfile`
  - Line 55: Removed `sudo \` from apt-get install
  - Line 100: Removed sudoers configuration
  - Lines 113-114: Added /go directory with claude ownership

**Verification**:
```bash
docker run --rm zeeke-ai-runner:latest which sudo
# Expected: (no output - sudo not found)

docker run --rm zeeke-ai-runner:latest id
# Expected: uid=1001(claude) gid=1001(claude)
```

**Result**: PASSED - Sudo completely removed, privilege escalation prevented

---

### Fix 2: Add PID Limits (P0 - CRITICAL) ✓

**Security Risk**: CVSS 5.3 - Resource exhaustion via fork bombs

**Implementation**:
- Added PID limit of 512 processes in docker-compose.yml
- Applied to both gha-runner and act-runner services

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/dahendel/projects/runner-worktrees/phase-5-security/docker-compose.yml`
  - Lines 86-89: Added `pids: 512` in deploy.resources.limits
  - Lines 133-134: Added PID limit for act-runner

**Verification**:
```bash
docker run --rm --pids-limit 512 zeeke-ai-runner:latest bash -c ':(){ :|:& };:'
# Expected: Fails with "Resource temporarily unavailable"
```

**Result**: PASSED - Fork bombs safely blocked

---

### Fix 3: Install Trivy Scanner (P1) ✓

**Security Risk**: Unknown vulnerabilities without continuous scanning

**Implementation**:
- Installed Trivy v0.48.3 in Dockerfile
- Created security scanning script (`scripts/security-scan.sh`)
- Integrated into build process

**Files Created**:
- `/home/dahendel/projects/runner-worktrees/phase-5-security/scripts/security-scan.sh`

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/dahendel/projects/runner-worktrees/phase-5-security/Dockerfile`
  - Lines 94-99: Install Trivy scanner

**Usage**:
```bash
# Scan image for vulnerabilities
./scripts/security-scan.sh zeeke-ai-runner:latest

# Or use Trivy directly
docker run --rm zeeke-ai-runner:latest trivy image zeeke-ai-runner:latest
```

**Result**: PASSED - Trivy installed and functional

---

### Fix 4: Implement Secret Management (P1) ✓

**Security Risk**: Accidental secret commits and credential exposure

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive secret patterns
- Created secret validation script
- Documented secret management best practices

**Files Created**:
- `/home/dahendel/projects/runner-worktrees/phase-5-security/scripts/validate-secrets.sh`

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/dahendel/projects/runner-worktrees/phase-5-security/.gitignore`
  - Lines 38-63: Added security patterns

**Secret Patterns Blocked**:
- API keys (*.key, *apikey*, etc.)
- Private keys (*.pem, *_rsa, *_dsa, etc.)
- Credentials (credentials.json, auth.json, token.json)
- Passwords (*password*, *passwd*)

**Verification**:
```bash
./scripts/validate-secrets.sh
# Expected: Scans repository for secret patterns
```

**Result**: PASSED - Secret protection automated

---

### Fix 5: Configure Network Isolation (P1) ✓

**Security Risk**: Lateral movement between containers

**Implementation**:
- Created dedicated runner-network with bridge driver
- Disabled inter-container communication (ICC)
- Configured subnet isolation

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/dahendel/projects/runner-worktrees/phase-5-security/docker-compose.yml`
  - Lines 80-81: Added network configuration
  - Lines 151-158: Network definition with ICC disabled

**Network Configuration**:
```yaml
networks:
  runner-network:
    driver: bridge
    driver_opts:
      com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc: "false"
```

**Verification**:
```bash
docker network inspect runner-network
# Check: "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc": "false"
```

**Result**: PASSED - Network isolation enforced

---

### Fix 6: Set Resource Limits (P1) ✓

**Security Risk**: Resource exhaustion attacks

**Implementation**:
- CPU limit: 4 cores
- Memory limit: 8GB
- CPU reservation: 2 cores
- Memory reservation: 4GB
- PID limit: 512 processes

**Files Modified**:
- `/home/dahendel/projects/runner-worktrees/phase-5-security/docker-compose.yml`
  - Lines 84-92: Resource limits configuration

**Resource Configuration**:
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '4'
      memory: 8G
      pids: 512
    reservations:
      cpus: '2'
      memory: 4G
```

**Verification**:
```bash
docker stats zeeke-ai-runner --no-stream
# Check: CPU and memory usage against limits
```

**Result**: PASSED - Resource limits enforced
